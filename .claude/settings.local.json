All extraction\nmethods failed with errors:\n- Failed to populate variable registry\n- Failed to extract variables  \n- Failed to extract color tokens\n- Failed to extract component tokens\n- Result: 0 tokens extracted\n\n## Root Cause\nThe plugin used documentAccess: \"dynamic-page\" which requires explicitly\nloading pages before accessing content. Our token extractor tried to access\nstyles and components directly without loading pages first.\n\n## The Fix\nChanged documentAccess from \"dynamic-page\" to \"current-page\" which allows\ndirect access to the current page''s content. This is the correct mode for\na design token extractor.\n\n## Impact\n✅ Plugin now successfully extracts all tokens from Figma files\n✅ Colors, typography, spacing, effects, and variables all working\n✅ GitHub push functionality working correctly\n\nThis is a critical update - all v1.3.0 users should upgrade immediately.\n\nFor detailed changes, see commit 0a6e414\nEOF\n)\")",
